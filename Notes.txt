Create a Kubernetes cluster
I created a basic cluster using minikube

Containerize the application using Docker (https://www.docker.com/)
Containarised the application using docker init and then tried running the image locally to see that it functions as expected.

Push the container image to a Container Registry 
I created an account at dockerhub and registered a public repository and pushed the image to the repository

Run the application inside your Kubernetes cluster. The application should be accessible from a browser.
I first got the application to run with a single yaml file for both the deployment and the services. Then I tested this with port forwarding to see that the application was reachable. I created a basic helm chart to be able to install the application as a package.


TODO:
- setup LoadBalancer so that application can be reached externally with hostname and cert.
- maybe look into pod securities that would be needed for this application?
- decide on how the application should scale, limit with resources? how many idle? etc.
- test an update for the application? How should it rollout? etc.
- push finished helm package to repository.
